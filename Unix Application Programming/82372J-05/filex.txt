  In Dedication of The Certain Hour

    Sad hours and glad hours and all hours pass over
  One thing unshaken stays
  Life that hath Death for spouse hath Chance for lover
  Whereby decays

    Each thing save one thingmid this strife diurnal
  Of hourly change begot
  Love that is Godborn bides as God eternal
  And changes not

    Nor means a tinseled dream pursuing lovers
  Find altered byandbye
  When with possession time anon discovers
  Trapped dreams must die

    For he that visions God of mankind gathers
  One manlike trait alone
  And reverently imputes to Him a fathers
  Love for his son

BALLAD OF THE DOUBLESOUL


Les Dieux qui trop aiment ses faceties cruellesPAUL VERVILLE


  In the beginning the Gods made man and fashioned the sky and the sea
  And the earths fair face for mans dwellingplace and
    this was the Gods decree

  Lo We have given to man five wits he discerneth folly and sin
  He is swift to deride all the world outside and blind
    to the world within

  So that man may make sport and amuse Us in battling
    for phrases or pelf
  Now that each may know what forebodeth woe to his
    neighbor and not to himself

  Yet some have the Gods forgottenor is it that subtler mirth
  The Gods extort of a certain sort of folk that cumber the earth

  For this is the song of the doublesoul distortedly two in one
  Of the wearied eyes that still behold the fruit ere the seed be sown
  And derive affright for the nearing night from the light
    of the noontide sun

  For one that with hope in the morning set forth and knew never a fear
  They have linked with another whom omens bother and
    he whispers in ones ear

  And one is fain to be climbing where only angels have trod
  But is fettered and tied to anothers side who fears that
    it might look odd

  And one would worship a woman whom all perfections dower
  But the other smiles at transparent wiles and he quotes
    from Schopenhauer

  Thus two by two we wrangle and blunder about the earth
  And that body we share we may not spare but the Gods
    have need of mirth

  So this is the song of the doublesoul distortedly two in one
  Of the wearied eyes that still behold the fruit ere the seed be sown
  And derive affright for the nearing night from the light
    of the noontide sun




AUCTORIAL INDUCTION

These questions so long as they remain with the Muses may very well
be unaccompanied with severity for where there is no other end of
contemplation and inquiry but that of pastime alone the understanding
is not oppressed but after the Muses have given over their riddles to
Sphinxthat is to practise which urges and impels to action choice
and determinationthen it is that they become torturing severe and
trying


  From the dawn of the day to the dusk he toiled
  Shaping fanciful playthings with tireless hands
  Useless trumpery toys and with vaulting heart
  Gave them unto all peoples who mocked at him
  Trampled on them and soiled them and went their way

  Then he toiled from the morn to the dusk again
  Gave his gimcracks to peoples who mocked at him
  Trampled on them deriding and went their way

  Thus he labors and loudly they jeer at him
  That is when they remember he still exists

  Who you ask is this fellowWhat matter names
  He is only a scribbler who is content

  FELIX KENNASTONThe ToyMaker




AUCTORIAL INDUCTION


WHICH AFTER SOME BRIEF DISCOURSE OF FIRES AND FRYINGPANS ELUCIDATES
THE INEXPEDIENCY OF PUBLISHING THIS BOOK AS WELL AS THE NECESSITY OF
WRITING IT  AND THENCE PASSES TO A MODEST DEFENSE OF MORE VITAL THEMES

The desire to write perfectly of beautiful happenings is as the saying
runs old as the hillsand as immortal  Questionless there was many
a serviceable brick wasted in Nineveh because finicky persons must
needs be deleting here and there a phrase in favor of its cuneatic
synonym and it is not improbable that when the outworn sun expires in
clinkers its final ray will gild such zealots tinkering with their
style Some few there must be in every age and every land of whom
life claims nothing very insistently save that they write perfectly of
beautiful happenings

Yet that the work of a man of letters is almost always a congenial
product of his day and environment is a contention as lacking in
novelty as it is in the need of any upholding here  Nor is the
rationality of that axiom far to seek for a man of genuine literary
genius since he possesses a temperament whose susceptibilities are of
wider area than those of any other is inevitably of all people the one
most variously affected by his surroundings  And it is he in
consequence who of all people most faithfully and compactly exhibits
the impress of his times and his times tendencies not merely in his
writingswhere it conceivably might be just predetermined
affectationbut in his personality

Such being the assumption upon which this volume is builded it appears
only equitable for the architect frankly to indicate his cornerstone
Hereinafter you have an attempt to depict a special temperamentone in
essence literaryas very variously molded by diverse eras and as
responding in proportion with its ability to the demands of a certain
hour

In proportion with its ability be it repeated since its ability is
singularly hampered  For apart from any ticklish temporal
considerations be it remembered life is always claiming of this
temperaments possessor that he write perfectly of beautiful happenings

To disregard this vital longing and flatly to stifle the innate
striving toward artistic creation is to become as with Wycherley and
Sheridan a man who waives however laughingly his sole apology for
existence  The proceeding is paltry enough in all conscience and
yet upon the other side there is much positive danger in giving to
the instinct a loose rein  For in that event the familiar
circumstances of sedate and wholesome living cannot but seem like
paintings viewed too near to lose in gusto and winsomeness  Desire
perhaps a craving hunger awakens for the impossible  No emotion
whatever be its sincerity is endured without a sideglance toward its
capabilities for being written about  The world in short inclines to
appear an illlit mine wherein one quarries gingerly amidst an abiding
loneliness as with Pope and Ufford and Sire Raimbautand wherein one
very often is allured into unsavory alleys as with Herrick and
Alessandro de Mediciin search of that raw material which loving
labor will transshape into comeliness

Such if it be allowed to shift the metaphor are the treacherous
bypaths of that admirably policed highway whereon the wellgroomed and
wellbitted Pegasi of Vanderhoffen and Charteris in his later manner
trot stolidly and safely toward oblivion  And the result of wandering
afield is of necessity a tragedy in that the deviators life if not
as an artists quite certainly as a human beings must in the outcome
be adjudged a failure

Hereinafter then you have an attempt to depict a special
temperamentone in essence literaryas very variously molded by
diverse eras and as responding in proportion with its ability to the
demands of a certain hour




II

And this much said it is permissible to hope at least that here and
there some reader may be found not wholly blind to this books goal
whatever be his opinion as to this books success in reaching it  Yet
many honest souls there be among us averagenovelreaders in whose eyes
this volume must rest content to figure as a collection of short
stories having naught in common beyond the feature that each deals with
the affaires du coeur of a poet

Such must always be the books interpretation by mental indolence  The
fact is incontestable and this fact in itself may be taken as
sufficient to establish the inexpediency of publishing The Certain
Hour  For that people will not buy a volume of short stories is
notorious to all publishers  To offset the axiom there are no doubt
incongruous phenomenaranging from the continued popularity of the
Bible to the present general esteem of Mr Kipling and embracing the
rather unaccountable vogue of O Henrybut none the less the
superstition has its force

Here intervenes the multifariousness of man pointed out somewhere by
Mr Gilbert Chesterton which enables the individual to be at once a
vegetarian a golfer a vestryman a blond a mammal a Democrat and
an immortal spirit  As a rational person one may debonairly consider
The Certain Hour possesses as large license to look like a volume of
short stories as say a backgammonboard has to its customary guise of
a twovolume history but as an averagenovelreader one must vote
otherwise  As an averagenovelreader one must condemn the very book
which as a seasoned scribbler one was moved to write through long
consideration of the drama already suggestedthat immemorial drama of
the desire to write perfectly of beautiful happenings and the obscure
martyrdom to which this desire solicits its possessor

Now clearly the struggle of a special temperament with a fixed force
does not forthwith begin another story when the locale of combat
shifts  The case is rather as whenwith certainly an intervening
change of apparelPompey fights Caesar at both Dyrrachium and
Pharsalus or as when General Grant successively encounters General Lee
at the Wilderness Spottsylvania Cold Harbor and Appomattox  The
combatants remain unchanged the question at issue is the same the
tragedy has continuity  And even so from the time of Sire Raimbaut to
that of John Charteris has a special temperament hearthungrily
confronted an ageless problem at what cost now in this fleet hour of
my vigor may one write perfectly of beautiful happenings


Thus logic urges with pathetic futility inasmuch as we
averagenovelreaders are profoundly indifferent to both logic and good
writing  And always the fact remains that to the mentally indolent
this book may well seem a volume of disconnected short stories  All of
us being more or less mentally indolent this possibility constitutes a
dire fault

Three other damning objections will readily obtrude themselves  The
Certain Hour deals with past epochsbeginning before the introduction
of dinnerforks and ending at that remote quaint period when people
used to waltz and twostepdead eras in which we averagenovelreaders
are not interested The Certain Hour assumes an appreciable amount of
culture and information on its purchasers part which we
averagenovelreaders either lack or else are unaccustomed to employ
in connection with reading for pastime andin our eyes the crowning
misdemeanorThe Certain Hour is not vital

Having thus candidly confessed these faults committed as the writer of
this book it is still possible in human multifariousness to consider
their enormity not merely in this book but in fictional
readingmatter at large as viewed by an averagenovelreaderby a
representative of that potent class whose preferences dictate the
nature and main trend of modern American literature  And to do this
it may be throws no unsalutary sidelight upon the stillexistent
problem at what cost now may one attempt to write perfectly of
beautiful happenings




III


Indisputably the most striking defect of this modern American
literature is the fact that the production of anything at all
resembling literature is scarcely anywhere apparent  Innumerable
printingpresses instead are turning out a vast quantity of
readingmatter the candidly recognized purpose of which is to kill
time and whichit has been asserted though perhaps too
sweepinglyought not to be vended over bookcounters but rather in
drugstores along with the other narcotics

It is begging the question to protest that the class of people who a
generation ago read nothing now at least read novels and to regard
this as a change for the better  By similar logic it would be more
wholesome to breakfast off laudanum than to omit the meal entirely
The nineteenth century in fact by making education popular has
produced in America the curious spectacle of a readingpublic with
essentially nonliterary tastes  Formerly better books were published
because they were intended for persons who turned to reading through a
natural bent of mind whereas the modern American novel of commerce is
addressed to us average people who read when we read at all in
violation of every innate instinct

Such grounds as yet exist for hopefulness on the part of those who
cordially care for belles lettres are to be found elsewhere than in
the crowded marketplaces of fiction where genuine intelligence
panders on all sides to ignorance and indolence  The phrase may seem
to have no very civil ring but reflection will assure the fairminded
that two indispensable requisites nowadays of a pecuniarily successful
novel are really that it make no demand upon the readers
imagination and that it rigorously refrain from assuming its reader to
possess any particular information on any subject whatever  The author
who writes over the head of the public is the most dangerous enemy of
his publisherand the most insidious as well because so many
publishers are in private life interested in literary matters and
would readily permit this personal foible to influence the exercise of
their vocation were it possible to do so upon the preferable side of
bankruptcy

But publishers among innumerable other conditions must weigh the fact
that no novel which does not deal with modern times is ever really
popular among the seriousminded  It is difficult to imagine a tale
whose action developed under the rule of the Caesars or the
Merovingians being treated as more than a literary hors doeuvre  We
purchasers of vital novels know nothing about the period beyond a
hazy association of it with the restrictions of the schoolroom our
sluggish imaginations instinctively rebel against the exertion of
forming any notion of such a period and all the human nature that
exists even in seriousminded persons is stirred up to resentment
against the books author for presuming to know more than a potential
patron  The book in fine simply irritates the seriousminded person
and shefor it is only women who willingly brave the terrors of
departmentstores where most of our new books are bought
nowadaysquite naturally puts it aside in favor of some keen and
daring study of American life that is warranted to grip the reader
So modernity of scene is everywhere necessitated as an essential
qualification for a books discussion at the literary evenings of the
local womans club and modernity of scene of course is almost always
fatal to the permanent worth of fictitious narrative

It may seem banal here to recall the truism that firstclass art never
reproduces its surroundings but such banality is often justified by
our human proneness to shuffle over the fact that many truisms are
true  And this one is preeminently indisputable that what mankind
has generally agreed to accept as firstclass art in any of the varied
forms of fictitious narrative has never been a truthful reproduction of
the artists era  Indeed in the higher walks of fiction art has never
reproduced anything but has always dealt with the facts and laws of
life as so much crude material which must be transmuted into
comeliness  When Shakespeare pronounced his celebrated dictum about
arts holding the mirror up to nature he was no doubt alluding to the
circumstance that a mirror reverses everything which it reflects

Nourishment for much wildish speculation in fact can be got by
considering what the worlds literature would be had its authors
restricted themselves as do we Americans so sedulouslyand
unavoidablyto writing of contemporaneous happenings  In
fictionmaking no author of the first class since Homers infancy has
ever in his happier efforts concerned himself at all with the great
problems of his particular day and among geniuses of the second rank
you will find such ephemeralities adroitly utilized only when they are
distorted into enduring parodies of their actual selves by the broad
humor of a Dickens or the colossal fantasy of a Balzac  In such cases
as the latter two writers however we have an otherwise competent
artist handicapped by a personality so marked that whatever he may
nominally write about the result is above all else an exposure of
the writers idiosyncrasies  Then too the laws of any locale wherein
Mr Pickwick achieves a competence in business or of a society wherein
Vautrin becomes chief of police are upon the face of it extramundane
It suffices that as a general rule in fictionmaking the true artist
finds an ample if restricted field wherein the proper functions of
the preacher or the ventriloquist or the photographer or of the
public prosecutor are exercised with equal lack of grace

Besides in dealing with contemporary life a novelist is goaded into
too many pusillanimous concessions to plausibility  He no longer moves
with the gait of omnipotence  It was very different in the palmy days
when Dumas was free to play at ducks and drakes with history and
Victor Hugo to reconstruct the whole system of English government and
Scott to compel the sun to set in the east whenever such minor changes
caused to flow more smoothly the progress of the tale these giants had
in hand  These freedoms are not tolerated in American noveldom and
only a few futile highbrows sigh in vain for Thackerays happy
harmless Fableland where these things are  The majority of us are
deep in vital novels  Nor is the reason far to seek




IV


One hears a great deal nowadays concerning vital books  Their
authors have been widely praised on very various grounds  Oddly
enough however the writers of these books have rarely been commended
for the really praiseworthy charity evinced therein toward that large
longsuffering class loosely describable as the averagenovelreader

Yet in connection with this fact it is worthy of more than passing
note that no great while ago the New York Times carefully selected
committee in picking out the hundred best books published during a
particular year declared as to novelsa best book in our opinion
is one that raises an important question or recurs to a vital theme
and pronounces upon it what in some sense is a last word  Now this
definition is not likely ever to receive more praise than it deserves
Cavilers may of course complain that actually to write the last word
on any subject is a feat reserved for the Recording Angels unique
performance on judgment Day  Even setting that objection aside it is
undeniable that no work of fiction published of late in America
corresponds quite so accurately to the terms of this definition as do
the multiplication tables  Yet the multiplication tables are not
without their claims to applause as examples of straightforward
narrative  It is also at least permissible to consider that therein
the numeral five say where it figures as protagonist unfolds under
the stress of its varying adventures as opulent a development of real
human nature as does through similar upsanddowns the Reverend John
Hodder in The Inside of the Cup  It is equally allowable to find the
less simple evolution of the digit seven more sympathetic upon the
whole than those of Undine Spragg in The Custom of the Country
But even so this definition of what may now authoritatively be
ranked as a best novel is an honest and noteworthy severance from
misleading literary associations such as have too long befogged our
notions about readingmatter  It points with emphasis toward the
altruistic obligations of taletellers to be vital

For we averagenovelreaderswe average people in a wordare now as
always rather pathetically hungry for vital themes such themes as
appeal directly to our everyday observation and prejudices  Did the
decision rest with us all novelists would be put under bond to confine
themselves forevermore to themes like these

As touches the appeal to everyday observation it is an old story at
least coeval with Mr Crummles not uncelebrated pumps and tubs if not
with the grapes of Zeuxis how unfailingly in art we delight to
recognize the familiar  A novel whose scene of action is explicit will
always interest the people of that locality whatever the books other
pretensions to consideration  Given simultaneously a photograph of
Murillos rendering of The Virgin Crowned Queen of Heaven and a
photograph of a governors installation in our State capital there is
no one of us but will quite naturally look at the latter first in
order to see if in it some familiar countenance be recognizable  And
thus upon a larger scale the twentieth century is preeminently
interested in the twentieth century

It is all very well to describe our averagenovelreaders dislike of
Romanticism as the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a
glass It is even within the scope of human dunderheadedness again to
point out here that the supreme artists in literature have precisely
this in common and this alone that in their masterworks they have
avoided the vital themes of their day with such circumspection as
lesser folk reserve for the smallpox  The answer of course in either
case is that the vital novel the novel which peculiarly appeals to
us averagenovelreaders has nothing to do with literature  There is
between these two no more intelligent connection than links the paint
Mr Sargent puts on canvas and the paint Mr Dockstader puts on his
face

Literature is made up of the rereadable books the books which it is
possiblefor the people so constituted as to care for that sort of
thingto read again and yet again with pleasure  Therefore in
literature a books subject is of astonishingly minor importance and
its style nearly everything whereas in books intended to be read for
pastime and forthwith to be consigned at random to the wastebasket or
to the inmates of some charitable institute the theme is of paramount
importance and ought to be a serious one  The modern novelist owes it
to his public to select a vital theme which in itself will fix the
readers attention by reason of its familiarity in the readers
everyday life

Thus a lady with whose more candid opinions the writer of this is more
frequently favored nowadays than of old formerly confessed to having
only one set rule when it came to investment in new
readingmatteralways to buy the Williamsons last book  Her reason
was the perfectly sensible one that the Williamsons plots used
invariably to pivot upon motortrips and she is an ardent
automobilist  Since as of late the Williamsons have seen fit to
exercise their typewriter upon other topics they have as a matter of
course lost her patronage

This principle of selection when you come to appraise it sanely is
the sole intelligent method of dealing with readingmatter  It seems
here expedient again to state the peculiar problem that we
averagenovelreaders have of necessity set the modern
novelistnamely that his books must in the main appeal to people who
read for pastime to people who read books only under protest and only
when they have no other employment for that particular halfhour

Now reading for pastime is immensely simplified when the books theme
is some familiar matter of the readers workaday life because at
outset the reader is spared considerable mental effort  The motorist
above referred to and indeed any averagenovelreader can without
exertion conceive of the Williamsons people in their automobiles
Contrariwise were these fictitious characters embarked in palankeens
or droshkies or jinrikishas more or less intellectual exercise would
be necessitated on the readers part to form a notion of the
conveyance  And we averagenovelreaders do not open a book with the
intention of making a mental effort  The author has no right to expect
of us an act so unhabitual we very poignantly feel  Our prejudices he
is freely chartered to stir upif lucky rogue he canbut he ought
with deliberation to recognize that it is precisely in order to avoid
mental effort that we purchase or borrow his book and afterward
discuss it

Hence arises our heartfelt gratitude toward such novels as deal with
vital themes with the questions we averagenovelreaders confront or
make talk about in those happier hours of our existence wherein we are
not reduced to reading  Thus a tale for example dealing either with
feminism or white slavery as the handiest makeshift of
spinsterdomor with the divorce habit and plutocratic iniquity in
general or with the probable benefits of converting clergymen to
Christianity or with how much more than she knows a desirable mother
will tell her childrenfinds the books tentative explorer just now
amply equipped with prejudices whether acquired by second thought or
second hand concerning the books topic  As endurability goes
reading the book rises forthwith almost to the level of an
afternooncall where there is gossip about the neighbors and Germanys
future  We averagenovelreaders may not in either case agree with
the opinions advanced but at least our prejudices are aroused and we
are interested

And these vital themes awake our prejudices at the cost of a
minimumif not always as when Miss Corelli guides us with a
positively negligibletasking of our mental faculties  For such
exemption we averagenovelreaders cannot  but be properly grateful
Nay more than this provided the novelist contrive to rouse our
prejudices it matters with us not at all whether afterward they be
soothed or harrowed  To implicate our prejudices somehow to raise in
us a partizanship in the tales progress is our sole request  Whether
this consummation be brought about through an arraignment of some
social condition which we personally either advocate or reprehendthe
attitude weighs littleor whether this interest be purchased with
placidly driveling preachments of generally uplifting
tendenciesvaguely titillating that vague intention which exists in us
all of becoming immaculate as soon as it is perfectly convenientthe
personal prejudices of us averagenovelreaders are not lightly lulled
again to sleep

In fact the jealousy of any human prejudice against hinted
encroachment may safely be depended upon to spur us through an
astonishing number of pagesfor all that it has of late been
complained among us with some show of extenuation that our original
intent in beginning certain of the recent vital novels was to kill
time rather than eternity  And so we averagenovelreaders plod on
jealously to the end whether we advance to cite examples already
somewhat of yesterday under the leadership of Mr Upton Sinclair
aspersing the integrity of modern sausages and millionaires or of Mr
Hall Caine saying about Roman Catholics what ordinary people would
hesitate to impute to their relatives by marriageor whether we be
more suavely allured onward by Mrs Florence Barclay or Mr Sydnor
Harrison with ingenuous indorsements of the New Testament and the
inherent womanliness of women

The vital theme then let it be repeated has two inestimable
advantages which should commend it to all novelists first it spares
us averagenovelreaders any preliminary orientation and thereby
mitigates the mental exertion of reading and secondly it appeals to
our prejudices which we naturally prefer to exercise and are
accustomed to exercise rather than our mental or idealistic faculties
The novelist who conscientiously bears these two facts in mind is
reasonably sure of his reward not merely in pecuniary form but in
those higher fields wherein he harvests his chosen publics honest
gratitude and affection

For we averagenovelreaders are quite frequently reduced by
circumstances to selfentrustment to the resources of the novelist as
to those of the dentist  Our latterday conditions as we cannot but
recognize necessitate the employment of both artists upon occasion
And with both we averagenovelreaders we average people are most
grateful when they make the process of resorting to them as easy and
unirritating as may be possible




V


So much for the plea of us averagenovelreaders and our plea we
think is rational  We are in the market for a specified article
and human ingenuity cooperating with human nature will inevitably
insure the manufacture of that article as long as any general demand
for it endures

Meanwhile it is small cause for grief that the purchaser of American
novels prefers Central Park to any wood near Athens and is more at
home in the Tenderloin than in Camelot  People whose tastes happen to
be literary are entirely too prone to too much longfaced prattle about
literature which when all is said is never a controlling factor in
anybodys life  The automobile and the telephone the accomplishments
of Mr Edison and Mr Burbank and it would be permissible to add of
Mr Rockefeller influence nowadays in one fashion or another every
moment of every living Americans existence whereas had America
produced instead a second Milton or a Dante it would at most have
caused a few of us to spend a few spare evenings rather differently

Besides we knoweven we averagenovelreadersthat America is in
fact producing her enduring literature day by day although as rarely
fails to be the case those who are contemporaneous with the makers of
this literature cannot with any certainty point them out  To voice a
hoary truism time alone is the test of vitality  In our present
flood of books as in any other flood it is the froth and scum which
shows most prominently  And the possession of vitality here as
elsewhere postulates that its possessor must ultimately perish

Nay by the time these printed pages are first read as printed pages
allusion to those modern authors whom these pages citethe preeminent
literary personages of that hour wherein these pages were writtenwill
inevitably have come to savor somewhat of antiquity so that sundry
references herein to the vital books now most in vogue will rouse
much that vague shrugging recollection as wakens say at a mention of
Dorothy Vernon or Three Weeks or Beverly of Graustark  And while
at first glance it might seem expedientin revising the last
proofsheets of these pagessomewhat to freshen them up by
substituting for the books herein referred to the vital and more
widely talkedof novels of the summer of  the task would be but
wasted labor since even these fascinating chronicles one comprehends
forlornly must needs be equally obsolete by the time these
proofsheets have been made into a volume  With malice aforethought
therefore the books and authors named herein stay those which all of
three years back our reviewers and advertising pages with perfect
gravity acclaimed as of enduring importance  For the quaintness of
that opinion nowadays may profitably round the moral that there is
really nothing whereto one may fittingly compare a successful
contribution to vital readingmatter as touches evanescence

And this is as it should be  Tout passeLart robust seul a
lternit precisely as Gautier points out with bracing
commonsense and it is excellent thus to comprehend that today as
always only through exercise of the auctorial virtues of distinction
and clarity of beauty and symmetry of tenderness and truth and
urbanity may a man in reason attempt to insure his books against
oblivions voracity

Yet the desire to write perfectly of beautiful happenings is as the
saying runs old as the hillsand as immortal  Questionless there
was many a serviceable brick wasted in Nineveh because finicky persons
must needs be deleting here and there a phrase in favor of its cuneatic
synonym and it is not improbable that when the outworn sun expires in
clinkers its final ray will gild such zealots tinkering with their
style  This then is the conclusion of the whole matter  Some few
there must be in every age and every land of whom life claims nothing
very insistently save that they write perfectly of beautiful
happenings  And even we averagenovelreaders know it is such folk who
are today making in America that portion of our literature which may
hope for permanency

BELHS CAVALIERS


For this RAIMBAUT DE VAQUIERAS lived at a time when prolonged habits
of extramundane contemplation combined with the decay of real
knowledge were apt to volatilize the thoughts and aspirations of the
best and wisest into dreamy unrealities and to lend a false air of
mysticism to love     It is as if the intellect and the will had
become used to moving paralytically among visions dreams and mystic
terrors weighed down with torpor


  Fair friend since that hour I took leave of thee
  I have not slept nor stirred from off my knee
  But prayed alway to God S Marys Son
  To give me back my true companion
      And soon it will be Dawn

  Fair friend at parting thy behest to me
  Was that all sloth I should eschew and flee
  And keep good Watch until the Night was done
  Now must my Song and Service pass for none
      For soon it will be Dawn

  RAIMBAUT DE VAQUIERASAubade from F York Powells version




BELHS CAVALIERS


You may read elsewhere of the long feud that was between Guillaume de
Baux afterward Prince of Orange and his kinsman Raimbaut de
Vaquieras  They were not reconciled until their youth was dead  Then
when Messire Raimbaut returned from battling against the Turks and the
Bulgarians in the th year from mans salvation the Archbishop of
Rheims made peace between the two cousins and attended by Makrisi a
converted Saracen who had followed the knights fortunes for well nigh
a quarter of a century the Sire de Vaquieras rode homeward

Many slain men were scattered along the highway when he came again into
Venaissin in April after an absence of thirty years  The crows whom
his passing disturbed were too sluggish for long flights and many of
them did not heed him at all  Guillaume de Baux was now undisputed
master of these parts although as this host of mute hacked and
partially devoured witnesses attested the contest had been dubious for
a while but now Lovain of the GreatTooth Prince Guillaumes last
competitor was captured the forces of Lovain were scattered and of
Lovains lieutenants only Mahi de Vernoil was unsubdued

Prince Guillaume laughed a little when he told his kinsman of the
posture of affairs as more loudly did Guillaumes gross son Sire
Philibert  But Madona Biatritz did not laugh  She was the widow of
Guillaumes dead brotherPrince Conrat whom Guillaume succeededand
it was in her honor that Raimbaut had made those songs which won him
eminence as a practitioner of the Gay Science

Biatritz said It is a long while since we two met

He that had been her lover all his life said Yes

She was no longer the most beautiful of women no longer his behymned
Belhs Cavaliersyou may read elsewhere how he came to call her that in
all his canzonsbut only a fine and gracious stranger  It was
uniformly gray that soft and plentiful hair where once such gold had
flamed as dizzied him to think of even now there was no crimson in
these thinner lips and candor would have found her eyes less wonderful
than those Raimbaut had dreamed of very often among an alien and
hostile people  But he lamented nothing and to him she was as ever
Heavens most splendid miracle

Yes said this old Raimbautand even today we have not reclaimed
the Sepulcher as yet  Oh I doubt if we shall ever win it now that
your brother and my most dear lord is dead  Both thought a while of
Boniface de Montferrat their playmate once who yesterday was King of
Thessalonica and now was so much Macedonian dust

She said  This week the Prince sent envoys to my nephew     And
so you have come home again  Color had surged into her timeworn
face and as she thought of things done long ago this womans eyes were
like the eyes of his young Biatritz  She said You never married

He answered  No I have left love alone  For Love prefers to take
rather than to give against a single happy hour he balances a hundred
miseries and he appraises one pleasure to be worth a thousand pangs
Pardieu let this immortal usurer contrive as may seem well to him for
I desire no more of his bounty or of his penalties

No we wish earnestly for nothing either good or bad said Dona
Biatritzwe who have done with loving

They sat in silence musing over ancient happenings and not looking at
each other until the Prince came with his guests who seemed to laugh
too heartily

Guillaumes frail arm was about his kinsman and Guillaume chuckled
over jests and bywords that had been between the cousins as children
Raimbaut found them no food for laughter now  Guillaume told all of
Raimbauts oath of fealty and of how these two were friends and their
unnatural feud was forgotten  For we grow oldeh maker of songs
he said and it is time we made our peace with Heaven since we are
not long for this world

Yes said the knight oh yes we both grow old  He thought of
another April evening so long ago when this Guillaume de Baux had
stabbed him in a hedged field near Calais and had left him under a
hawthorn bush for dead and Raimbaut wondered that there was no anger
in his heart  We are friends now he said  Biatritz whom these two
had loved and whose vanished beauty had been the spur of their long
enmity sat close to them and hardly seemed to listen

Thus the evening passed and every one was merry because the Prince had
overcome Lovain of the GreatTooth and was to punish the upstart on
the morrow  But Raimbaut de Vaquieras a spent fellow a derelict
barren of aim now that the Holy Wars were over sat in this unfamiliar
placewhere when he was young he had laughed as a cock crowsand
thought how at the last he had crept home to die as a dependent on his
cousins bounty

Thus the evening passed and at its end Makrisi followed the troubadour
to his regranted fief of Vaquieras  This was a chill and brilliant
night swayed by a frozen moon so powerful that no stars showed in the
unclouded heavens and everywhere the bogs were curdled with thin ice
An obdurate wind swept like a knifeblade across a world which even in
its spring seemed very old

This night is bleak and evil Makrisi said  He rode a coffins
length behind his master  It is like Prince Guillaume I think  What
man will sorrow when dawn comes

Raimbaut de Vaquieras replied  Always dawn comes at last Makrisi

It comes the more quickly messire when it is prompted

The troubadour only smiled at words which seemed so meaningless  He
did not smile when later in the night Makrisi brought Mahi de Vernoil
disguised as a mendicant friar  This outlaw pleaded with Sire Raimbaut
to head the tatters of Lovains army and showed Raimbaut how easy it
would be to wrest Venaissin from Prince Guillaume  We cannot save
Lovain de Vemoil said for Guillaume has him fast  But Venaissin is
very proud of you my tres beau sire  Ho maker of worldfamous songs
stout champion of the faith my men and I will now make you Prince of
Orange in place of the fiend who rules us  You may then at your
convenience wed Madona Biatritz that most amiable lady whom you have
loved so long  And by the Cross you may do this before the week is
out

The old knight answered  It is true that I have always served Madona
Biatritz who is of matchless worth  I might not therefore presume
to call myself any longer her servant were my honor stained in any
particular  Oh no Messire de Vernoil an oath is an oath  I have
this day sworn fealty to Guillaume de Baux

Then after other talk Raimbaut dismissed the fierceeyed little man
The freebooter growled curses as he went  On a sudden he whistled
like a person considering and he began to chuckle

Raimbaut said more lately  Zoraida left no wholesome legacy in you
Makrisi  This Zoraida was a woman the knight had known in
Constantinoplea comely outlander who had killed herself because of
Sire Raimbauts highflown avoidance of all womankind except the
mistress of his youth

Nay save only in loving you too well messire was Zoraida a wise
woman notably     But this is outworn talk the prattle of Cains
babyhood  As matters were you did not love Zoraida  So Zoraida died
Such is the custom in my country

You trouble me Makrisi  Your eyes are like blown coals     Yet
you have served me long and faithfully  You know that mine was ever
the vocation of dealing honorably in battle among emperors and of
spreading broadcast the rumor of my valor and of achieving good by my
swords labors  I have lived by warfare  Long long ago since I
derived no benefit from love I cried farewell to it

Ay said Makrisi  Love makes a demigod of alljust for an hour
Such hours as follow we devote to the concoction of sleepingdraughts
He laughed and very harshly

And Raimbaut did not sleep that night because this life of ours seemed
such a piece of tanglework as he had not the skill to unravel  So he
devoted the wakeful hours to composition of a planh lamenting vanished
youth and that Biatritz whom the years had stolen

Then on the ensuing morning after some talk about the new campaign
Prince Guillaume de Baux leaned back in his high chair and said
abruptly

In perfect candor you puzzle your liegelord  For you loathe me and
you still worship my sisterinlaw an unattainable princess  In these
two particulars you display such wisdom as would inevitably prompt you
to make an end of me  Yet what the devil you the timebattered
vagabond decline happiness and a kingdom to boot because of
yesterdays mummery in the cathedral because of a mere promise given
Yes I have my spies in every rathole  I am aware that my barons hate
me and hate Philibert almost as bitterlyand that in fine a
majority of my barons would prefer to see you Prince in my unstable
place on account of your praiseworthy molestations of heathenry  Oh
yes I understand my barons perfectly  I flatter myself I understand
everybody in Venaissin save you

Raimbaut answered You and I are not alike

No praise each and every Saint said the Prince of Orange heartily
And yet I am not sure  He rose for his sight had failed him so
that he could not distinctly see you except when he spoke with head
thrown back as though he looked at you over a wall  For instance do
you understand that I hold Biatritz here as a prisoner because her
dowerlands are necessary to me and that I intend to marry her as soon
as Pope Innocent grants me a dispensation

All Venaissin knows that  Yes you have always gained everything
which you desired in this world Guillaume  Yet it was at a price I
think

I am no haggler    But you have never comprehended me not even in
the old days when we loved each other  For instance do you
understandslave of a spoken wordwhat it must mean to me to know
that at this hour tomorrow there will be alive in Venaissin no person
whom I hate

Messire de Vaquieras reflected  His was never a rapid mind  Why no
I do not know anything about hatred he said at last  I think I
never hated any person

Guillaume de Baux gave a halffrantic gesture  Now Heaven send you
troubadours a clearer understanding of what sort of world we live
in  He broke off short and growled And yetsometimes I envy
you Raimbaut

They rode then into the Square of St Michel to witness the death of
Lovain  Guillaume took with him his two new mistresses and all his
byblows each magnificently clothed as if they rode to a festival
Afterward before the doors of Lovains burning house a rope was
fastened under Lovains armpits and he was gently lowered into a pot
of boiling oil  His feet cooked first and then the flesh of his legs
and so on upward while Lovain screamed  Guillaume in a loose robe of
green powdered with innumerable silver crescents sat watching under a
canopy woven very long ago in Tarshish and cunningly embroidered with
the figures of peacocks and apes and men with eagles heads  His hands
caressed each other meditatively


It was on the afternoon of this day the last of April that Sire
Raimbaut came upon Madona Biatritz about a strange employment in the
Ladies Court  There was then a well in the midst of this enclosure
with a granite ledge around it carven with lilies and upon this she
leaned looking down into the water  In her lap was a rope of pearls
which one by one she unthreaded and dropped into the well

Clear and warm the weather was  Without forests were quickening
branch by branch as though a green flame smoldered from one bough to
another  Violets peeped about the roots of trees and all the world
was young again  But here was only stone beneath their feet and about
them showed the high walls and the leadsheathed towers and the
parapets and the sunk windows of Guillaumes chateau  There was no
color anywhere save gray and Raimbaut and Biatritz were aging people
now  It seemed to him that they were the wraiths of those persons who
had loved each other at Montferrat and that the walls about them and
the leaden devils who grinned from every waterspout and all those dark
and narrow windows were only part of some magic picture such as a
sorceress may momentarily summon out of smokewreaths as he had seen
Zoraida do very long ago

This woman might have been a wraith in verity for she was clothed
throughout in white save for the ponderous gold girdle about her
middle  A white gorget framed the face which was so pinched and shrewd
and strange and she peered into the well smiling craftily

I was thinking death was like this well said Biatritz without any
cessation of her singular employmentso dark that we may see nothing
clearly save one faint gleam which shows us or which seems to show us
where rest is  Yes yes this is that chaplet which you won in the
tournament at Montferrat when we were young  Pearls are the symbol of
tears we read  But we had no time for reading then no time for
anything except to be quite happy     You saw this mornings work
Raimbaut were Satan to go mad he would be such a fiend as this
Guillaume de Baux who is our master

Ay the man is as cruel as my old opponent Mourzoufle Sire Raimbaut
answered with a patient shrug  It is a great mystery why such
persons should win all which they desire of this world  We can but
recognize that it is for some sufficient reason  Then he talked with
her concerning the aforementioned infamous emperor of the East against
whom the old knight had fought and of Enrico Dandolo and of King
Boniface dead brother to Madona Biatritz and of much remote
outlandish adventuring oversea  Of Zoraida he did not speak  And
Biatritz in turn told him of that one child which she had borne her
husband Prince Conrata son who died in infancy and she spoke of
this dead baby who living would have been their monarch with a sweet
quietude that wrung the old knights heart

Thus these spent people sat and talked for a long while the talk
veering anywhither just as chance directed  Blurred gusts of song and
laughter would come to them at times from the hall where Guillaume de
Baux drank with his courtiers and these would break the tranquil flow
of speech  Then unvexedly the gentle voice of the speaker were it
his or hers would resume

She said They laugh  We are not merry

No he replied I am not often merry  There was a time when love
and its service kept me in continuous joy as waters invest a fish  I
woke from a high dream     And then but for the fear of seeming
cowardly I would have extinguished my life as men blow out a candle
Vanity preserved me sheer vanity  He shrugged spreading his hard
lean hands  Belhs Cavaliers I grudged my enemies the pleasure of
seeing me forgetful of valor and noble enterprises  And so since
then I have served Heaven in default of you

I would not have it otherwise she said half as in wonder I would
not have you be quite sane like other men  And I believe she
addedstill with her wise smileyou have derived a deal of comfort
off and on from being heartbroken

He replied gravely  A man may always if he will but take the pains
be tolerably content and rise in worth and yet dispense with love  He
has only to guard himself against baseness and concentrate his powers
on doing right  Thus therefore when fortune failed me I persisted
in acting to the best of my ability  Though I had lost my lands and my
loved lady I must hold fast to my own worth  Without a lady and
without acreage it was yet in my power to live a cleanly and honorable
life and I did not wish to make two evils out of one

Assuredly I would not have you be quite sane like other men she
repeated  It would seem that you have somehow blundered through long
years preserving always the ignorance of a child and the blindness of
a child  I cannot understand how this is possible nor can I keep from
smiling at your highflown notions and yetI envy you Raimbaut


Thus the afternoon passed and the rule of Prince Guillaume was made
secure  His supper was worthily appointed for Guillaume loved color
and music and beauty of every kind and was on this the day of his
triumph in a prodigal humor  Many lackeys in scarlet brought in the
first course to the sound of exultant drums and pipes with a blast of
trumpets and a waving of banners so that all hearts were uplifted and
Guillaume jested with harsh laughter

But Raimbaut de Vaquieras was not mirthful for he was remembering a
boy whom he had known of very long ago  He was swayed by an odd fancy
as the men sat over their wine and jongleurs sang and performed tricks
for their diversion that this boy so frank and excellent as yet
existed somewhere and that the Raimbaut who moved these shriveled
hands before him on the table there was only a sad dream of what had
never been  It troubled him too to see how grossly these soldiers
ate for as a person of refinement an associate of monarchs Sire
Raimbaut when the dishes were passed picked up his meats between the
index and the middlefinger of his left hand and esteemed it infamous
manners to dip any other fingers into the gravy

Guillaume had left the Warriors Hall  Philibert was drunk and half
the menatarms were snoring among the rushes when at the height of
their festivity Makrisi came  He plucked his master by the sleeve

A swarthy bearded Angevin was singing  His song was one of old Sire
Raimbauts famous canzons in honor of Belhs Cavaliers  The knave was
singing blithely

  Pus mos Belhs Cavaliers grazitz
  E joys mes lunhatz e faiditz
  Don no m venra jamais conortz
  Fer quees mayer lira e plus fortz


The Saracen had said nothing  He showed a jeweled dagger and the
knight arose and followed him out of that uproarious hall  Raimbaut
was bitterly perturbed though he did not know for what reason as
Makrisi led him through dark corridors to the dullgleaming arras of
Prince Guillaumes apartments  In this corridor was an iron lamp swung
from the ceiling and now as this lamp swayed slightly and burned low
the tiny flame leaped clear of the wick and was extinguished and
darkness rose about them

Raimbaut said What do you want of me  Whose blood is on that knife

Have you forgotten it is Walburgas Eve Makrisi said  Raimbaut did
not regret he could not see his servants countenance  Time was we
named it otherwise and praised another woman than a Saxon wench but
let the new name stand  It is Walburgas Eve that little little hour
of evil and all over the world surges the full tide of hells desire
and mischief is amaking now apace apace apace  People moan in
their sleep and many pillows are pricked by needles that have sewed a
shroud  Cry Eman hetan now messire for there are those tonight
who find the big cathedrals of your redroofed Christian towns no more
imposing than so many pimples on a butlers chin because they ride so
high so very high in this brave moonlight  Fulltide fulltide
Makrisi said and his voice jangled like a bell as he drew aside the
curtain so that the old knight saw into the room beyond

It was a place of many lights which when thus suddenly disclosed
blinded him at first  Then Raimbaut perceived Guillaume lying asprawl
across an oaken chest  The Prince had fallen backward and lay in this
posture glaring at the intruders with horrible eyes which did not move
and would not ever move again  His breast was crimson for some one
had stabbed him  A woman stood above the corpse and lighted yet
another candle while Raimbaut de Vaquieras waited motionless  A hand
meant only to bestow caresses brushed a lock of hair from this womans
eyes while he waited  The movements of this hand were not uncertain
but only quivered somewhat as a taut wire shivers in the wind while
Raimbaut de Vaquieras waited motionless

I must have lights I must have a host of candles to assure me past
any questioning that he is dead  The man is of deep cunning  I think
he is not dead even now  Lightly Biatritz touched the Princes
breast  Strange that this wicked heart should be so tranquil when
there is murder here to make it glad  Nay very certainly this
Guillaume de Baux will rise and laugh in his old fashion before he
speaks and then I shall be afraid  But I am not afraid as yet  I am
afraid of nothing save the dark for one cannot be merry in the dark

Raimbaut said  This is Belhs Cavaliers whom I have loved my whole
life through  Therefore I do not doubt  Pardieu I do not even doubt
who know she is of matchless worth

Wherein have I done wrong Raimbaut  She came to him with fluttering
hands  Why but look you the man had laid an ambuscade in the marsh
and he meant to kill you there tonight as you rode for Vaquieras  He
told me of it told me how it was for that end alone he lured you into
Venaissin  Again she brushed the hair back from her forehead
Raimbaut I spoke of God and knightly honor and the man laughed  No
I think it was a fiend who sat so long beside the window yonder whence
one may see the marsh  There were no candles in the room  The
moonlight was upon his evil face and I could think of nothing of
nothing that has been since Adams time except our youth Raimbaut
And he smiled fixedly like a white image because my misery amused
him  Only when I tried to go to you to warn you he leaped up
stiffly making a mewing noise  He caught me by the throat so that I
could not scream  Then while we struggled in the moonlight your
Makrisi came and stabbed him

Nay I but fetched this knife messire  Makrisi seemed to love that
bloodied knife

Biatritz proudly said The man lies Raimbaut

What need to tell me that Belhs Cavaliers

And the Saracen shrugged  It is very true I lie he said  As among
friends I may confess I killed the Prince  But for the rest take
notice both of you I mean to lie intrepidly

Raimbaut remembered how his mother had given each of two lads an apple
and he had clamored for Guillaumes as children do and Guillaume had
changed with him  It was a trivial happening to remember after fifty
years but Guillaume was dead and this hacked flesh was Raimbauts
flesh in part and the thought of Raimbaut would never trouble
Guillaume de Baux any more  In addition there was a fire of juniper
wood and frankincense upon the hearth and the room smelt too cloyingly
of bedrugging sweetness  Then on the walls were tapestries which
depicted Merlins Dream so that everywhere recoiling women smiled with
bold eyes and here their wantonness seemed out of place

Listen Makrisi was saying listen for the hour strikes  At last
at last he cried with a shrill whine of malice

Raimbaut said dully  Oh I do not understand

And yet Zoraida loved you once loved you as people love where I was
born  The Saracens voice had altered  His speech was like the
rustle of papers  You did not love Zoraida  And so it came about
that upon Walburgas Eve at midnight Zoraida hanged herself beside
your doorway  Thus we love where I was born     And I I cut the
ropewith my left hand  I had my other arm about that frozen thing
which yesterday had been Zoraida you understand so that it might not
fall  And in the act a tear dropped from that dead womans cheek and
wetted my forehead  Ice is not so cold as was that tear     Ho
that tear did not fall upon my forehead but on my heart because I
loved that dancinggirl Zoraida as you do this princess here  I
think you will understand Makrisi said calmly as one who states a
maxim

The Sire de Vaquieras replied in the same tone I understand  You
have contrived my death

Ey messire would that be adequate  I could have managed that any
hour within the last score of years  Oh no for I have studied you
carefully  Oh no  instead I have contrived this plight  For the
Prince of Orange is manifestly murdered  Who killed himwhy Madona
Biatritz and none other for I will swear to it  I I will swear to
it who saw it done  Afterward both you and I must be questioned upon
the rack as possibly concerned in the affair and whether innocent or
guilty we must die very horribly  Such is the gentle custom of your
Christian country when a prince is murdered  That is not the point of
the jest however  For first Sire Philibert will put this woman to the
Question by Water until she confesses her confederates until she
confesses that every baron whom Philibert distrusts was one of them
Oh yes assuredly they will thrust a hollow cane into the mouth of your
Biatritz and they will pour water a little by a little through this
cane until she confesses what they desire  Ha Philibert will see to
this confession  And through this womans torment he will rid himself
of every dangerous foe he has in Venaissin  You must stand by and wait
your turn  You must stand by in fetters and see this doneyou you
my masteryou who love this woman as I loved that dead Zoraida who
was not fair enough to please you

Raimbaut trapped impotent cried out This is not possible  And
for all that he knew the Saracen to be foretelling the inevitable

Makrisi went on quietly  After the Question men will parade her
naked to the middle through all Orange until they reach the
Marketplace where will be four horses  One of these horses they will
harness to each arm and leg of your Biatritz  Then they will beat
these horses  These will be strong horses  They will each run in a
different direction

This infamy also was certain  Raimbaut foresaw what he must do  He
clutched the dagger which Makrisi fondled  Belhs Cavaliers this
fellow speaks the truth  Look now the moon is oldis it not strange
to know it will outlive us

And Biatritz came close to Sire Raimbaut and said I understand  If I
leave this room alive it will purchase a hideous suffering for my poor
body it will bring about the ruin of many brave and innocent
chevaliers  I know  I would perforce confess all that the masked men
bade me  I know for in Prince Conrats time I have seen persons who
had been put to the Question  She shuddered and she rebegan
without any agitation  Give me the knife Raimbaut

Pardieu but I may not obey you for this once he answered since we
are informed by those in holy orders that all such as lay violent hands
upon themselves must suffer eternally  Then kneeling he cried in
an extremity of adoration  Oh I have served you all my life  You
may not now deny me this last service  And while I talk they dig your
grave  O blind men making the new grave take heed lest that grave be
too narrow for already my heart is breaking in my body  I have drunk
too deep of sorrow  And yet I may not fail you now that honor and
mercy and my love for you demand I kill you before I also diein such
a fashion as this fellow speaks of

She did not dispute this  How could she when it was an axiom in all
Courts of Love that Heaven held dominion in a lovers heart only as an
underling of the mans mistress

And so she said with a fond smile  It is your demonstrable
privilege  I would not grant it dear were my weak hands as clean as
yours  Oh but it is long you have loved me and it is faithfully you
have served Heaven and my heart too is breaking in my body now that
your service ends

And he demanded wearily  When we were boy and girl together what had
we said if any one had told us this would be the end

We would have laughed  It is a long while since those children
laughed at Montferrat    Not yet not yet she said  Ah pity
me tried champion for even now I am almost afraid to die

She leaned against the window yonder shuddering staring into the
night  Dawn had purged the east of stars  Day was at hand the day
whose noon she might not hope to witness  She noted this incuriously
Then Biatritz came to him very strangely proud and yet all tenderness

See now Raimbaut because I have loved you as I have loved nothing
else in life I will not be unworthy of your love  Strike and have
done

Raimbaut de Vaquieras raised an already bloodied dagger  As emotion
goes he was bankrupt  He had no longer any dread of hell because he
thought that a little later nothing its shrewdest overseer could plan
would have the power to vex him  She waiting smiled  Makrisi
seated stretched his legs put fingertips together with the air of an
attendant amateur  This was better than he had hoped  In such a
posture they heard a bustle of armored men and when all turned saw
how a sword protruded through the arras

Come out Guillaume people were shouting  Unkennel dog  Out
out and die  To such a heralding Mahi de Vernoil came into the room
with mincing steps such as the man affected in an hour of peril  He
first saw what a grisly burden the chest sustained  Now by the
Face he cried if he that cheated me of quieting this filth should
prove to be of gentle birth I will demand of him a duel to the death
The curtains were ripped from their hangings as he spoke and behind
him the candlelight was reflected by the armor of many followers

Then de Vernoil perceived Raimbaut de Vaquieras and the spruce little
man bowed ceremoniously  All were still  Composedly like a
lieutenant before his captain Mahi narrated how these hunted remnants
of Lovains army had as a last cast that night invaded the chateau
and had found thanks to the festival its menatarms in uniform and
inefficient drunkenness  My tres beau sire Messire de Vernoil
ended will you or nill you Venaissin is yours this morning  My
knaves have slain Philibert and his bewildered fellowtipplers with
less effort than is needed to drown as many kittens

And his followers cried as upon a signal Hail Prince of Orange

It was so like the wonderworking of a dreamthis sudden and heroic
uproarthat old Raimbaut de Vaquieras stood reeling near to intimacy
with fear for the first time  He waited thus with both hands pressed
before his eyes  He waited thus for a long while because he was not
used to find chance dealing kindlily with him  Later he saw that
Makrisi had vanished in the tumult and that many people awaited his
speaking

The lord of Venaissin began You have done me a great service Messire
de Vemoil  As recompense I give you what I may  I freely yield you
all my right in Venaissin  Oh no kingcraft is not for me  I daily
see and hear of battles won cities beleaguered high towers
overthrown and ancient citadels and new walls leveled with the dust
I have conversed with many kings the directors of these events and
they were not happy people  Yes yes I have witnessed divers
happenings for I am old     I have found nothing which can serve
me in place of honor

He turned to Dona Biatritz  It was as if they were alone  Belhs
Cavaliers he said I had sworn fealty to this Guillaume  He
violated his obligations but that did not free me of mine  An oath is
an oath  I was and am today sworn to support his cause and to
profit in any fashion by its overthrow would be an abominable action
Nay more were any of his adherents alive it would be my manifest duty
to join them against our preserver Messire de Vernoil  This necessity
is very happily spared me  I cannot though in honor hold any fief
under the supplanter of my liegelord  I must therefore relinquish
Vaquieras and take eternal leave of Venaissin  I will not lose the
right to call myself your servant he cried outand that which is
noblest in the world must be served fittingly  And so Belhs
Cavaliers let us touch palms and bid farewell and never in this life
speak face to face of trivial happenings which we two alone remember
For naked of lands and gear I came to youa princes daughtervery
long ago and as nakedly I now depart so that I may retain the right
to say All my life long I served my love of her according to my
abilities wholeheartedly and with clean hands

Yes yes you must depart from Venaissin said Dona Biatritz  A
capable woman she had no sympathy with his exquisite points of honor
and yet loved him all the more because of what seemed to her his
surpassing folly  She smiled somewhat as mothers do in humoring an
unreasonable boy  We will go to my nephews court at Montferrat she
said  He will willingly provide for his old aunt and her husband
And you may still make versesat Montferrat where we lived verses
once Raimbaut

Now they gazed full upon each other  Thus they stayed transfigured
neither seeming old  Each had forgotten that unhappiness existed
anywhere in the whole world  The armored bloodstained men about them
were of no more importance than were those wantons in the tapestry
Without dawn throbbed in heaven  Without innumerable birds were
raising that glad piercing hurried morningsong which very anciently
caused Adams primal waking to behold his mate




BALTHAZARS DAUGHTER


A curious preference for the artificial should be mentioned as
characteristic of ALESSANDRO DE MEDICIS poetry  For his century was
anything but artless the great commonplaces that form the main stock
of human thought were no longer in their first flush and he addressed
a people no longer childish     Unquestionably his fancies were
fantastic antinatural bordering on hallucination and they betray a
desire for impossible novelty but it is allowable to prefer them to
the sickly simplicity of those socalled poems that embroider with old
faded wools upon the canvas of wornout truisms trite trivial and
idiotically sentimental patterns


  Let me have dames and damsels richly clad
    To feed and tend my mirth
  Singing by day and night to make me glad

  Let me have fruitful gardens of great girth
    Filld with the strife of birds
  With watersprings and beasts that house i the earth

  Let me seem Solomon for lore of words
  Samson for strength for beauty Absalom

    Knights as my serfs be given
  And as I will let music go and come
  Till when I will I will to enter Heaven

  ALESSANDRO DE MEDICIMadrigal from D G Rossettis version




BALTHAZARS DAUGHTER

Graciosa was Balthazars youngest child a white slim girl with violet
eyes and strange pale hair which had the color and glitter of stardust
Some day at court her father often thought complacently she too
will make a good match  He was a necessitous lord a smiling supple
man who had already marketed two daughters to his advantage  But
Graciosas time was not yet mature in the year of grace  for the
girl was not quite sixteen  So Graciosa remained in Balthazars big
cheerless house and was tutored in all needful accomplishments  She
was proficient in the making of preserves and unguents could play the
harpsichord and the virginals acceptably could embroider an altarcloth
to admiration and in spite of a trivial lameness in walking could
dance a coranto or a saraband against any woman between two seas

Now to the north of Balthazars home stood a tall forest overhanging
both the highway and the river whose windings the highway followed
Graciosa was very often to be encountered upon the outskirts of these
woods  She loved the forest whose tranquillity bred dreams but was
already a woman in so far that she found it more interesting to watch
the highway  Sometimes it would be deserted save for small purple
butterflies which fluttered about as if in continuous indecision and
rarely ascended more than a foot above the ground  But people passed
at intervalsas now a page who was a notably fine fellow clothed in
ashcolored gray with slashed puffed sleeves and having a herons
feather in his cap or a Franciscan with his gown tucked up so that you
saw how the veins on his naked feet stood out like the carvings on a
vase or a farmer leading a calf or a gentleman in a mantle of
squirrels fur riding beside a wonderful proud lady whose tiny hat was
embroidered with pearls  It was all very interesting to watch it was
like turning over the leaves of a book written in an unknown tongue and
guessing what the pictures meant because these people were intent upon
their private avocations in which you had no part and you would never
see them any more

Then destiny took a hand in the affair and Guido came  He reined his
gray horse at the sight of her sitting by the wayside and deferentially
inquired how far it might be to the nearest inn  Graciosa told him
He thanked her and rode on  That was all but the appraising glance of
this sedate and handsome burgher obscurely troubled the girl afterward

Next day he came again  He was a jewelmerchant he told her and he
thought it within the stretch of possibility that my lord Balthazars
daughter might wish to purchase some of his wares  She viewed them
with admiration chaffered thriftily and finally bought a topaz dug
from Mount Zabarca Guido assured her which rendered its wearer immune
to terrors of any kind

Very often afterward these two met on the outskirts of the forest as
Guido rode between the coast and the hillcountry about his vocation
Sometimes he laughingly offered her a bargain on other days he paused
to exhibit a notable gem which he had procured for this or that wealthy
amateur  Count Eglamore the young Dukes favorite yonder at court
bought most of them it seemed  The nobles complain against this
upstart Eglamore very bitterly said Guido but we merchants have no
quarrel with him  He buys too lavishly

I trust I shall not see Count Eglamore when I go to court said
Graciosa meditatively and indeed by that time my father assures
me some honest gentleman will have contrived to cut the throat of this
abominable Eglamore  Her fathers people it should be premised had
been at bitter feud with the favorite ever since he detected and
punished the conspiracy of the Marquis of Cibo their kinsman  Then
Graciosa continued  Nevertheless I shall see many beautiful sights
when I am taken to court     And the Duke too you tell me is an
amateur of gems

Eh madonna I wish that you could see his jewels cried Guido
growing fervent and he lovingly catalogued a host of lapidary marvels

I hope that I shall see these wonderful jewels when I go to court
said Graciosa wistfully

Duke Alessandro he returned his dark eyes strangely mirthful is
as I take it a catholic lover of beauty in all its forms  So he will
show you his gems very assuredly and worse still he will make
verses in your honor  For it is a preposterous feature of Duke
Alessandros character that he is always making songs

Oh and such strange songs as they are too Guido  Who does not know
them

I am not the best possible judge of his verses merit Guido
estimated drily  But I shall never understand how any singer at all
came to be locked in such a prison  I fancy that at times the paradox
puzzles even Duke Alessandro

And is he as handsome as people report

Then Guido laughed a little  Tastes differ of course  But I think
your father will assure you madonna that no duke possessing such a
zealous taxcollector as Count Eglamore was ever in his lifetime
considered of repulsive person

And is he young

Why as to that he is about of an age with me and in consequence old
enough to be far more sensible than either of us is ever likely to be
said Guido and began to talk of other matters

But presently Graciosa was questioning him again as to the court
whither she was to go next year and enslave a marquis or at worst an
opulent baron  Her thoughts turned toward the courts predominating
figure  Tell me of Eglamore Guido

Madonna some say that Eglamore was a brewers son  Othersand your
fathers kinsmen in particularinsist that he was begot by a devil in
person just as Merlin was and Plato the philosopher and puissant
Alexander  Nobody knows anything about his origin Guido was sitting
upon the ground his open pack between his knees  Between the thumb
and forefinger of each hand he held caressingly a string of pearls
which he inspected as he talked  Nobody he idly said nobody is
very eager to discuss Count Eglamores origin now that Eglamore has
become indispensable to Duke Alessandro  Yes it is thanks to Eglamore
that the Duke has ample leisure and needful privacy for the pursuit of
recreations which are reputed to be curious

I do not understand you Guido  Graciosa was all wonder

It is perhaps as well the merchant said a trifle sadly  Then Guido
shrugged  To be brief madonna business annoys the Duke  He finds
in this Eglamore an industrious person who affixes seals draughts
proclamations makes treaties musters armies devises pageants and
collects revenues upon the whole quite as efficiently as Alessandro
would be capable of doing these things  So Alessandro makes verses and
amuses himself as his inclinations prompt and Alessandros people are
none the worse off on account of it

Heigho I foresee that I shall never fall in love with the Duke
Graciosa declared  It is unbefitting and it is a little cowardly for
a prince to shirk the duties of his station  Now if I were Duke I
would grant my father a pension and have Eglamore hanged and purchase
a new gown of silvery green in which I would be ravishingly beautiful
and afterward Why what would you do if you were Duke Messer Guido

What would I do if I were Duke he echoed  What would I do if I
were a great lord instead of a tradesman  I think you know the answer
madonna

Oh you would make me your duchess of course  That is quite
understood said Graciosa with the lightest of laughs  But I was
speaking seriously Guido

Guido at that considered her intently for a halfminute  His
countenance was of portentous gravity but in his eyes she seemed to
detect a lurking impishness

And it is not a serious matter that a peddler of crystals should have
dared to love a noblemans daughter  You are perfectly right  That I
worship you is an affair which does not concern any person save myself
in any way whatsoever although I think that knowledge of the fact
would put your father to the trouble of sharpening his dagger   
Indeed I am not certain that I worship you for in order to adore
wholeheartedly the idolater must believe his idol to be perfect  Now
your nails are of an ugly shape like that of little fans your mouth
is too large and I have long ago perceived that you are a trifle lame
in spite of your constant care to conceal the fact  I do not admire
these faults for faults they are undoubtedly  Then too I know you
are vain and selfseeking and look forward contentedly to the time
when your father will transfer his ownership of such physical
attractions as heaven gave you to that nobleman who offers the highest
price for them  It is true you have no choice in the matter but you
will participate in a monstrous bargain and I would prefer to have you
exhibit distaste for it  And with that he returned composedly to
inspection of his pearls

And to what end Guido  It was the first time Graciosa had
completely waived the reticence of a superior caste  You saw that the
childs parted lips were tremulous and you divined her childish fits
of dreading that glittering inevitable courtlife shared with an
unimaginable husband

But Guido only grumbled whimsically  I am afraid that men do not
always love according to the strict laws of logic  I desire your
happiness above all things yet to see you so abysmally untroubled by
anything that troubles me is another matter

But I am not untroubled Guido she began swiftly  Graciosa broke
off in speech shrugged flashed a smile at him  For I cannot fathom
you Ser Guido and that troubles me  Yes I am very fond of you and
yet I do not trust you  You tell me you love me greatly  It pleases
me to have you say this  You perceive I am very candid this morning
Messer Guido  Yes it pleases me and I know that for the sake of
seeing me you daily endanger your life for if my father heard of our
meetings he would have you killed  You would not incur such
harebrained risks unless you cared very greatly and yet somehow I
do not believe it is altogether for me you care

Then Guido was in train to protest an allmastering and entirely candid
devotion but he was interrupted

Most women have these awkward intuitions spoke a melodious voice
and turning Graciosa met the eyes of the intruder  This magnificent
young man had a proud and bloodless face which contrasted sharply with
his painted lips and cheeks  In the contour of his protruding mouth
showed plainly his negroid ancestry  His scanty beard as well as his
frizzled hair was the color of dead grass  He was sumptuously clothed
in white satin worked with silver and around his cap was a gold chain
hung with diamonds  Now he handed his fringed ridinggloves to Guido
to hold

Yes madonna I suspect that Eglamore here cares greatly for the fact
that you are Lord Balthazars daughter and cousin to the late Marquis
of Cibo  For Cibo has many kinsmen at court who still resent the
circumstance that the matching of his wits against Eglamores earned
for Cibo a deplorably public demise  So they conspire against Eglamore
with vexatious industry as an upstart as a nobody thrust over people
of proven descent and Eglamore goes about in hourly apprehension of a
knifethrust  If he could make a match with you though your
fatherthrifty manwould be easily appeased  Your cousins those
proud grumbling CastelFranchi Strossi and Valori would not prove
overobdurate toward a kinsman who whatever his past indiscretions
has so many pensions and offices at his disposal  Yes honor would
permit a truce and Eglamore could bind them to his interests within
ten days and be rid of the necessity of sleeping in chain armor   
Have I not unraveled the scheme correctly Eglamore

Your highness was never lacking in penetration replied the other in
a dull voice  He stood motionless holding the gloves his shoulders a
little bowed as if under some physical load  His eyes were fixed upon
the ground  He divined the change in Graciosas face and did not care
to see it

And so you are Count Eglamore said Graciosa in a sort of whisper
That is very strange  I had thought you were my friend Guido  But I
forget  I must not call you Guido any longer  She gave a little
shiver here  He stayed motionless and did not look at her  I have
often wondered what manner of man you were  So it was youwhose hand
I touched just nowyou who poisoned Duke Cosmo you who had the good
cardinal assassinated you who betrayed the brave lord of Faenza  Oh
yes they openly accuse you of every imaginable crimethis patient
Eglamore this reptile who has crept into his power through filthy
passages  It is very strange you should be capable of so much
wickedness for to me you seem only a sullen lackey

He winced and raised his eyes at this  His face remained
expressionless  He knew these accusations at least to be demonstrable
lies for as it happened he had never found his advancement to hinge
upon the commission of the crimes named  But even so the past was a
cemetery he did not care to have revivified

And it was you who detected the Marquis of Cibos conspiracy
Tebaldeo was my cousin Count Eglamore and I loved him  We were
reared together  We used to play here in these woods and I remember
how Tebaldeo once fetched me a wrens nest from that maple yonder  I
stood just here  I was weeping because I was afraid he would fall  If
he had fallen and been killed it would have been the luckier for him
Graciosa sighed  They say that he conspired  I do not know  I only
know that by your orders Count Eglamore my playmate Tebaldeo was
fastened upon a Saint Andrews cross and his arms and legs were each
broken in two places with an iron bar  Then your servants took
Tebaldeo still living and laid him upon a carriagewheel which was
hung upon a pivot  The upper edge of this wheel was cut with very fine
teeth like those of a saw so that his agony might be complete
Tebaldeos poor mangled legs were folded beneath his body so that his
heels touched the back of his head they tell me  In such a posture he
died very slowly while the wheel turned very slowly there in the sunlit
marketplace and flies buzzed greedily about him and the shopkeepers
took holiday in order to watch Tebaldeo diethe same Tebaldeo who once
fetched me a wrens nest from yonder maple

Eglamore spoke now  I gave orders for the Marquis of Cibos
execution  I did not devise the manner of his death  The punishment
for Cibos crime was long ago fixed by our laws  Cibo plotted to kill
the Duke  Cibo confessed as much

But the girl waved this aside  And then you plan this masquerade
You plan to make me care for you so greatly that even when I know you
to be Count Eglamore I must still care for you  You plan to marry me
so as to placate Tebaldeos kinsmen so as to bind them to your
interests  It was a fine bold stroke of policy I know to use me as a
steppingstone to safetybut was it fair to me  Her voice rose now a
little  She seemed to plead with him  Look you Count Eglamore I
was a child only yesterday  I have never loved any man  But you have
loved many women I know and long experience has taught you many ways
of moving a womans heart  Oh was it fair was it worth while to
match your skill against my ignorance  Think how unhappy I would be if
even now I loved you and how I would loathe myself     But I am
getting angry over nothing  Nothing has happened except that I have
dreamed in idle moments of a brave and comely lover who held his head
so high that all other women envied me and now I have awakened

Meanwhile it was with tears in his eyes that the young man in white
had listened to her quiet talk for you could nowhere have found a
nature more readily sensitive than his to all the beauty and wonder
which life as if it were haphazardly produces every day  He pitied
this betrayed child quite ineffably because in her sorrow she was so
pretty

So he spoke consolingly  Fie Donna Graciosa you must not be too
harsh with Eglamore  It is his nature to scheme and he weaves his
plots as inevitably as the spider does her web  Believe me it is
wiser to forget the rascalas I dountil there is need of him and I
think you will have no more need to consider Eglamores trickeries for
you are very beautiful Graciosa

He had drawn closer to the girl and he brought a cloying odor of
frangipani bergamot and vervain  His nostrils quivered his face had
taken on an odd pinched look for all that he smiled as over some
occult jest  Graciosa was a little frightened by his bearing which
was both furtive and predatory

Oh do not be offended for I have some rights to say what I desire in
these parts  For Dei gratia I am the overlord of these parts
Graciosaa neglected prince who wondered over the frequent absences of
his chief counselor and secretly set spies upon him  Eglamore here
will attest as much  Or if you cannot believe poor Eglamore any
longer I shall have other witnesses within the halfhour  Oh yes
they are to meet me here at noonsome twenty crophaired stalwart
cutthroats  They will come riding upon beautiful broadchested horses
covered with red velvet trappings that are hung with little silver
bells which jingle delightfully  They will come very soon and then we
will ride back to court

Duke Alessandro touched his big painted mouth with his forefinger as if
in fantastic mimicry of a man imparting a confidence

I think that I shall take you with me Graciosa for you are very
beautiful  You are as slim as a lily and more white and your eyes are
two purple mirrors in each of which I see a tiny image of Duke
Alessandro  The woman I loved yesterday was a big splendid wench with
cheeks like apples  It is not desirable that women should be so large
All women should be little creatures that fear you  They should have
thin plaintive voices and in shrinking from you be as slight to the
touch as a cobweb  It is not possible to love a woman ardently unless
you comprehend how easy it would be to murder her

God God said Count Eglamore very softly for he was familiar with
the look which had now come into Duke Alessandros face  Indeed all
persons about court were quick to notice this odd pinched look like
that of a traveler nipped at by frosts and people at court became
obsequious within the instant in dealing with the fortunate woman who
had aroused this look Count Eglamore remembered

And the girl did not speak at all but stood motionless staring in
bewildered pitiable childlike fashion and the color had ebbed from
her countenance

Alessandro was frankly pleased  You fear me do you not Graciosa
See now when I touch your hand it is soft and cold as a serpents
skin and you shudder  I am very tired of women who love me of all
women with bold hungry eyes  To you my touch will always be a
martyrdom you will always loathe me and therefore I shall not weary
of you for a long while  Come Graciosa  Your father shall have all
the wealth and state that even his greedy imaginings can devise so
long as you can contrive to loathe me  We will find you a suitable
husband  You shall have flattery and titles gold and fine glass soft
stuffs and superb palaces such as are your beautys due henceforward

He glanced at the peddlers pack and shrugged  So Eglamore has been
wooing you with jewels  You must see mine dear Graciosa  It is not
merely an affair of possessing as some emperors do all the four kinds
of sapphires the twelve kinds of emeralds the three kinds of rubies
and many extraordinary pearls diamonds cymophanes beryls green
peridots tyanos sandrastra and fiery cinnamonstoneshe enumerated
them with the tender voice of their loverfor the value of these may
at least be estimated  Oh no I have in my possession gems which have
not their fellows in any other collection gems which have not even a
name and the value of which is incalculablestrange jewels that were
shot from inaccessible mountain peaks by means of slings jewels
engendered by the thunder jewels taken from the heart of the Arabian
deer jewels cut from the brain of a toad and the eyes of serpents and
even jewels that are authentically known to have fallen from the moon
We will select the rarest and have a pair of slippers encrusted with
them in which you shall dance for me

Highness cried Eglamore with anger and terror at odds in his
breast Highness I love this girl

Ah then you cannot ever be her husband Duke Alessandro returned
You would have suited otherwise  No no we must seek out some other
person of discretion  It will all be very amusing for I think that
she is now quite innocent as pure as the high angels are  See
Eglamore she cannot speak she stays still as a lark that has been
taken in a snare  It will be very marvelous to make her as I
am    He meditated as obscurely aware of opposition his
shoulders twitched fretfully and momentarily his eyes lightened like
the glare of a cannon through its smoke  You made a beast of me some
longfaced people say  Beware lest the beast turn and rend you

Count Eglamore plucked aimlessly at his chin  Then he laughed as a dog
yelps  He dropped the gloves which he had held till this
deliberately as if the act were a rite  His shoulders straightened
and purpose seemed to flow into the man  No he said quietly I
will not have it  It was not altogether I who made a brainsick beast
of you my prince but even so I have never been too nice to profit by
your vices  I have taken my thrifty toll of abomination I have stood
by contentedly not urging you on yet never trying to stay you as you
waded deeper and ever deeper into the filth of your debaucheries
because meanwhile you left me so much power  Yes in some part it is
my own handiwork which is my ruin  I accept it  Nevertheless you
shall not harm this child

I venture to remind you Eglamore that I am still the master of this
duchy  Alessandro was languidly amused and had begun to regard his
adversary with real curiosity

Oh yes but that is nothing to me  At court you are the master  At
court I have seen mothers raise the veil from their daughters faces
with smiles that were more loathsome than the grimaces of a fiend
because you happened to be passing  But here in these woods your
highness I see only the woman I love and the man who has insulted her

This is very admirable fooling the Duke considered  So all the
world is changed and Pandarus is transformed into Hector  These are
sonorous words Eglamore but with what deeds do you propose to back
them

By killing you your highness

So said the Duke  The farce ascends in interest He drew with a
flourish with actual animation for sottish debauched and
powercrazed as this man was he came of a race to whom danger was a
cordial  Very luckily a sword forms part of your disguise so let us
amuse ourselves  It is always diverting to kill and if by any chance
you kill me I shall at least be rid of the intolerable knowledge that
tomorrow will be just like today  The Duke descended blithely into
the level road and placed himself on guard

Then both men silently went about the business in hand  Both were
oddly calm almost as if preoccupied by some more important matter to
be settled later  The two swords clashed gleamed rigidly for an
instant and then their rapid interplay so far as vision went melted
into a flickering snarl of silver for the sun was high and each mans
shadow was huddled under him  Then Eglamore thrust savagely and in the
act trod the edge of a puddle and fell ignominiously prostrate  His
sword was wrenched ten feet from him for the Duke had parried
skilfully  Eglamore lay thus at Alessandros mercy

Well well the Duke cried petulantly and am I to be kept waiting
forever  You were a thought quicker in obeying my caprices yesterday
Get up you muddy lout and let us kill each other with some pretension
of adroitness

Eglamore rose and sobbing caught up his sword and rushed toward the
Duke in an agony of shame and rage  His attack now was that of a
frenzied animal quite careless of defense and desirous only of murder
Twice the Duke wounded him but it was Alessandro who drew backward
composedly hindering the brutal onslaught he was powerless to check
Then Eglamore ran him through the chest and gave vent to a strangled
growling cry as Alessandro fell  Eglamore wrenched his sword free and
grasped it by the blade so that he might stab the Duke again and again
He meant to hack the abominable flesh to slash and mutilate that
haughty mask of infamy but Graciosa clutched his weapon by the hilt

The girl panted and her breath came thick  He gave you your life

Eglamore looked up  She leaned now upon his shoulder her face
brushing his as he knelt over the unconscious Duke and Eglamore found
that at her dear touch all passion had gone out of him

Madonna he said equably the Duke is not yet dead  It is
impossible to let him live  You may think he voiced only a caprice
just now  I think so too but I know the man and I know that all this
madmans whims are ruthless and irresistible  Living Duke
Alessandros appetites are merely whetted by opposition so much so
that he finds no pleasures sufficiently piquant unless they have Gods
interdiction as a sauce  Living he will make of you his plaything
and a little later his broken soiled and castby plaything  It is
therefore necessary that I kill Duke Alessandro

She parted from him and he too rose to his feet

And afterward she said quietly and afterward you must die just as
Tebaldeo died

That is the law madonna  But whether Alessandro enters hell today
or later I am a lost man

Oh that is very true she said  A moment since you were Count
Eglamore whom every person feared  Now there is not a beggar in the
kingdom who would change lots with you for you are a friendless and
hunted man in peril of dreadful death  But even so you are not
penniless Count Eglamore for these jewels here which formed part of
your masquerade are of great value and there is a world outside  The
frontier is not two miles distant  You have only to escape into the
hillcountry beyond the forest and you need not kill Duke Alessandro
after all  I would have you go hence with hands as clean as possible

Perhaps I might escape  He found it quaint to note how calm she was
and how tranquilly his own thoughts ran  But first the Duke must die
because I dare not leave you to his mercy

How does that matter she returned  You know very well that my
father intends to market me as best suits his interests  Here I am so
much merchandise  The Duke is as free as any other man to cry a
bargain He would have spoken in protest but Graciosa interrupted
wearily  Oh yes it is to this end only that we daughters of Duke
Alessandros vassals are nurtured just as you told meeh how long
agothat such physical attractions as heaven accords us may be
marketed  And I do not see how a wedding can in any way ennoble the
transaction by causing it to profane a holy sacrament  Ah no
Balthazars daughter was near attaining all that she had been taught to
desire for a purchaser came and he bid lavishly  You know very well
that my father would have been delighted  But you must need upset the
bargain  No I will not have it Count Eglamore must cry  It cost
you very highly to speak those words  I think it would have puzzled my
father to hear those words at which so many fertile lands stout
castles welltimbered woodlands herds of cattle gilded coaches
liveries and curious tapestries fine clothing and spiced foods all
vanished like a puff of smoke  Ah yes my father would have thought
you mad

I had no choice he said and waved a little gesture of impotence
He spoke as with difficulty almost wearily  I love you  It is a
theme on which I do not embroider  So long as I had thought to use you
as an instrument I could woo fluently enough  Today I saw that you
were frightened and helplessoh quite helpless  And something
changed in me  I knew for the first time that I loved you and that I
was not clean as you are clean  What it was of passion and horror of
despair and adoration and yearning which struggled in my being then I
cannot tell you  It spurred me to such action as I tookbut it has
robbed me of sugared eloquence it has left me chary of speech  It is
necessary that I climb very high because of my love for you and upon
the heights there is silence

And Graciosa meditated  Here I am so much merchandise  Heigho since
I cannot help it since bought and sold I must be one day or another
at least I will go at a noble price  Yet I do not think I am quite
worth the value of these castles and lands and other things which you
gave up because of me so that it will be necessary to make up the
difference dear by loving you very much

And at that he touched her chin gently and masterfully for Graciosa
would have averted her face and it seemed to Eglamore that he could
never have his fill of gazing on the radiant shamed tenderness of
Graciosas face  Oh my girl he whispered  Oh my wonderful
worshiped merry girl whom God has fashioned with such loving care
you who had only scorn to give me when I was a kingdoms master and
would you go with me now that I am friendless and homeless

But I shall always have a friend she answereda friend who showed
me what Balthazars daughter was and what love is  And I am vain
enough to believe I shall not ever be very far from home so long as I
am near to my friends heart

A mortal man could not but take her in his arms

Farewell Duke Alessandro then said Eglamore farewell poor clay
so plastic the least touch remodels you  I had a part in shaping you
so bestial our age too had a partour bright and cruel day wherein
you were set too high  Yet for me it would perhaps have proved as easy
to have made a learned recluse of you Alessandro or a bloodless
saint if to do that had been as patently profitable  For you and all
your kind are so much putty in the hands of circumspect fellows such as
I  But I stood by and let our poisoned age conform that putty into the
shape of a crazed beast because it took that form as readily as any
other and in taking it best served my selfish ends  Now I must pay
for that sorry shaping just as I think you too must pay some day
And so I cry farewell with loathing but with compassion also

Then these two turned toward the hills leaving Duke Alessandro where
he lay in the road a very lamentable figure in much bloodied finery
They turned toward the hills and entered a forest whose ordering was
times contemporary and where there was no grandeur save that of the
trees

But upon the summit of the nearest hill they paused and looked over a
restless welter of foliage that glittered in the sun far down into the
highway  It bustled like an unroofed anthill for the road was alive
with men who seemed from this distance very small  Duke Alessandros
attendants had found him and were clustered in a hubbub about their
reviving master  Dwarfish Lorenzino de Medici was the most solicitous
among them

Beyond was the broad river seen as a ribbon of silver now and on its
remoter bank the leaded roofs of a strong fortress glistened like a
childs new toy  Tilled fields showed here and there no larger in
appearance than so many outspread handkerchiefs  Far down in the east
a small black smudge upon the pearlcolored and vaporous horizon was
all they could discern of a walled city filled with factories for the
working of hemp and furs and alum and silk and bitumen

It is a very rich and lovely land said Eglamorethis kingdom which
a halfhour since lay in the hollow of my hand  He viewed it for a
while and not without pensiveness  Then he took Graciosas hand and
looked into her face and he laughed joyously




JUDITHS CREED


It does not appear that the age thought his works worthy of
posterity nor that this great poet himself levied any ideal tribute on
future times or had any further prospect than of present popularity
and present profit  So careless was he indeed of fame that when he
retired to ease and plenty while he was yet little declined into the
vale of years and before he could be disgusted with fatigue or
disabled by infirmity he desired only that in this rural quiet he who
had so long mazed his imagination by following phantoms might at last
be cured of his delirious ecstasies and as a hermit might estimate the
transactions of the world




  Now my charms are all oerthrown
  And what strength I haves my own
  Which is most faint

                    Now I want
  Spirits to enforce art to enchant
  And my ending is despair
  Unless I be relieved by prayer
  Which pierces so that it assaults
  Mercy itself and frees all faults

  As you from crimes would pardond be
  Let your indulgence set me free

  WILLIAM SHAKESPEAREEpilogue to The Tempest



He was hoping while his fingers drummed in unison with the beat of his
verse that this last play at least would rouse enthusiasm in the pit
The welcome given its immediate predecessors had undeniably been tepid
A memorandum at his elbow of the receipts at the Globe for the last
quarter showed this with disastrous bluntness and after all in 
a shareholder in a theater when writing dramas for production there
was ordinarily subject to more claims than those of his ideals

He sat in a neglected garden whose growth was in reversion to primal
habits  The season was September the sky a uniform and temperate
blue  A peachtree laden past its strength with fruitage made about
him with its boughs a sort of tent  The grass around his writingtable
was largely hidden by long crinkled peach leavessome brown and
others gray as yetand was dotted with a host of brightlycolored
peaches  Fidgeting bees and flies were excavating the decayed spots in
this wasting fruit from which emanated a vinous odor  The bees hummed
drowsily their industry facilitating idleness in others  It was
curioushe meditated his thoughts straying from an uninhabited
islandhow these insects alternated in color between brown velvet and
silver as they blundered about a flickering tessellation of amber and
dark green    in search of rottenness   

He frowned  Here was an arid forenoon as imagination went  A seasoned
plagiarist by this he opened a book which lay upon the table among
several others and duly found the chapter entitled Of the Cannibals

So so he said aloud  It is a nation would I answer Plato
that has no kind of traffic no knowledge of letters  And with
that he sat about reshaping Montaignes conceptions of Utopia into
verse  He wrotewhile his left hand held the book flatas orderly as
any countyclerk might do in the recordance of a deed of sale

Midcourse in larceny he looked up from writing  He saw a tall dark
lady who was regarding him halfsorrowfully and half as in the grasp of
some occult amusement  He said nothing  He released the telltale
book  His eyebrows lifted banteringly  He rose

He found it characteristic of her that she went silently to the table
and compared the printed page with what he had just written  So
nowadays you have turned pickpocket  My poet you have altered

He said  Why yes  When you broke off our friendship I paid you the
expensive compliment of falling very ill  They thought that I would
die  They tell me even today I did not die  I almost question it
He shrugged  And today I must continue to write plays because I
never learned any other trade  And so at need I pilfer  The topic
did not seem much to concern him

Eh and such plays the woman cried  My poet there was a time when
you created men and women as glibly as Heaven does  Now you make
sugarcandy dolls

The last comedies were not all I could have wished he assented  In
fact I got only some L clear profit

There speaks the little tradesman I most hated of all persons living
the woman sighed  Now as in impatience she thrust back her
travelinghood and stood bareheaded

Then she stayed silenttall extraordinarily pallid and with dark
steady eyes  Their gaze by ordinary troubled you as seeming to hint
some knowledge to your belittlement  The playmaker remembered that
Now he a reputable householder was wondering what would be the upshot
of this intrusion  His visitor as he was perfectly aware had little
patience with such moments of life as could not be made dramatic   
He was recollecting many trifles now his mind ran upon old
times     No no reflection assured him to call her beautiful
would be and must always have been an exaggeration but to deny the
exotic and somewhat sinister charm of her even today would be an
absurdity

She said abruptly  I do not think I ever loved you as women love
men  You were too anxious to associate with fine folk too eager to
secure a patronyes and to get your profit of himand you were
always illatease among us  Our youth is so long past and we two are
so altered that we I think may speak of its happenings now without
any bitterness  I hated those sordid petty traits  I raged at your
incessant pretensions to gentility because I knew you to be so much
more than a gentleman  Oh it infuriated mehow long ago it wasto
see you cringing to the Court blockheads and running their errands
and smirkingly pocketing their money and wheedling them into helping
the new play to success  You complained I treated you like a lackey
it was not unnatural when of your own freewill you played the lackey so
assiduously

He laughed  He had anatomized himself too frequently and with too much
dispassion to overlook whatever tang of snobbishness might be in him
and moreover the charge thus tendered became in reality the speakers
apology and hurt nobodys selfesteem

Faith I do not say you are altogether in the wrong he assented
They could be very useful to mePembroke and Southampton and those
othersand so I endeavored to render my intimacy acceptable  It was
my business as a poet to make my play as near perfect as I could and
this attended to commonsense demanded of the theatermanager that he
derive as much money as was possible from its representation  What
would you have  The man of letters like the carpenter or the
blacksmith must live by the vending of his productions not by the
eating of them The woman waved this aside

She paced the grass in meditation the peach leaves brushing her proud
headcaressingly it seemed to him  Later she came nearer in a
brandnew mood  She smiled now and her voice was musical and thrilled
with wonder  But what a poet Heaven had locked inside this little
parasite  It used to puzzle me  She laughed and ever so lightly
Eh and did you never understand why by preference I talked with you
at evening from my balcony  It was because I could forget you then
entirely  There was only a voice in the dark  There was a sorcerer at
whose bidding words trooped like a conclave of emperors and now sang
like a bevy of linnets  And wit and fancy and high aspirations and my
lovebecause I knew then that your love for me was splendid and
divinethese also were my sorcerers potent allies  I understood then
how glad and awed were those fabulous Greekish queens when a god wooed
them  Yes then I understood  How long ago it seems

Yes yes he sighed  In that fullblooded season was Guenevere a
lass I think and Charlemagne was not yet in breeches

And when there was a new play enacted I was glad  For it was our play
that you and I had polished the last line of yesterday and all these
people wept and laughed because of what we had done  And I was
proud  The lady shrugged impatiently  Proud did I say and
glad  That attests how woefully I fall short of you my poet  You
would have found some magic phrase to make that ancient glory
articulate I know  Yetdid I ever love you  I do not know that  I
only know I sometimes fear you robbed me of the power of loving any
other man

He raised one hand in deprecation  I must remind you he cried
whimsically that a burnt child dreads even to talk of fire

Her response was a friendly nod  She came yet nearer  What she
demanded and her smile was elfish what if I had lied to you  What
if I were hideously tired of my husband that bluff stolid captain
What if I wanted you to plead with me as in the old time

He said  Until now you were only a woman  Oh and now my dear you
are again that resistless gipsy who so merrily beguiled me to the very
heart of loss  You are Love  You are Youth  You are Comprehension
You are all that I have had and lost and vainly hunger for  Here in
this abominable village there is no one who understandsnot even
those who are more dear to me than you are  I know  I only spoil good
paper which might otherwise be profitably used to wrap herrings in
they think  They give me ink and a pen just as they would give toys to
a child who squalled for them too obstinately  And Poesy is a thrifty
oracle with no words to waste upon the deaf however loudly her
interpreter cry out to her  Oh I have hungered for you my proud
dark lady the playmaker said

Afterward they stood quite silent  She was not unmoved by his outcry
and for this very reason was obscurely vexed by the reflection that it
would be the essay of a braver man to remedy rather than to lament
his circumstances  And then the moments rapture failed him

I am a sorry fool he said and lightly he ran on  You are a
skilful witch  Yet you have raised the ghost of an old madness to no
purpose  You seek a masterpoet  You will find none here  Perhaps I
was one once  But most of us are poets of one sort or another when we
love  Do you not understand  Today I do not love you any more than I
do Hecuba  Is it not strange that I should tell you this and not be
moved at all  Is it not laughable that we should stand here at the
last two feet apart as things physical go and be as profoundly
severed as if an ocean tumbled between us

He fell to walking to and fro his hands behind his back  She waited
used as she was to his unstable temperament a trifle puzzled
Presently he spoke

There was a time when a masterpoet was needed  He was
foundnayrather made  Fate hastily caught up a man not very
different from the run of menone with a taste for stringing phrases
and with a comedy or so to his discredit  Fate merely bid him love a
headstrong child newly released from the nursery

We know her well enough she said  The girl was faithless and
tyrannous and proud and coquettish and unworthy and false and
inconstant  She was black as hell and dark as night in both her person
and her living  You were not niggardly of vituperation

And he grimaced  Faith he replied but sonnets are a more natural
form of expression than affidavits and they are made effective by
compliance with different rules  I find no flagrant fault with you
today  You were a child of seventeen the darling of a noble house
and an actoryes and not even a preeminent actora gross poor
posturing vagabond just twice your age presumed to love you  What
child would not amuse herself with such engaging toys  Vivacity and
prettiness and cruelty are the ordinary attributes of kittenhood  So
you amused yourself  And I submitted with clear eyes because I could
not help it  Yes I who am by nature not disposed to underestimate my
personal importanceI submitted because your mockery was more
desirable than the adoration of any other woman  And all this helped
to make a masterpoet of me  Eh why not when such monstrous passions
spoke through meas if some implacable god elected to play godlike
music on a mountebanks lute  And I made admirable plays  Why not
when there was no tragedy more poignant than mineand where in any
comedy was any figure onehalf so ludicrous as mine  Ah yes Fate
gained her ends as always

He was a paunchy inconsiderable little man  By ordinary his elongated
features and high bald forehead loaned him an aspect of serene and
axiombased wisdom much as we see him in his portraits but now his
countenance was flushed and mobile  Odd passions played about it as
when on a sullen night in August summer lightnings flicker and merge

His voice had found another cadence  But Fate was not entirely
ruthless  Fate bade the child become a woman and so grow tired of all
her childhoods playthings  This was after a long while as we
estimate happenings     I suffered then  Yes I went down to the
doors of death as people say in my long illness  But that crude
corporal fever had a providential thievishness and not content with
stripping me of health and strengthnot satisfied with pilfering
inventiveness and any strong hunger to createwhy that insatiable
fever even robbed me of my insanity  I lived  I was only a broken
instrument flung by because the god had wearied of playing  I would
give forth no more heartwringing music for the musician had departed
And I still livedI the stout little tradesman whom you loathed
Yes that tradesman scrambled through these evils somehow and came
out still able to word adequately all such imaginings as could be
devised by his natural abilities  But he transmitted no more
heartwringing music

She said You lie

He said I thank Heaven daily that I do not  He spoke the truth
She knew it and her heart was all rebellion

Indefatigable birds sang through the following hush  A wholesome and
temperate breeze caressed these silent people  Bees that would die
tomorrow hummed about them tirelessly

Then the poet said  I loved you and you did not love me  It is the
most commonplace of tragedies the heart of every man alive has been
wounded in this identical fashion  A masterpoet is only that wounded
manamong so many other bleeding folkwho perversely augments his
agony and utilizes his wound as an inkwell  Presently time scars over
the cut for him as time does for all the others  He does not suffer
any longer  No and such relief is a clear gain but none the less he
must henceforward write with ordinary ink such as the lawyers use

I should have been the man the woman cried  Had I been sure of
fame could I have known those raptures when you used to gabble
immortal phrases like a stammering infant I would have paid the price
without all this whimpering

Faith and I think you would have he assented  There is the
difference  At bottom I am a creature of the most moderate
aspirations as you always complained and for my part Fate must in
reason demand her applause of posterity rather than of me  For I
regret the unlived life that I was meant forthe comfortable level
life of little happenings which all my schoolfellows have passed
through in a stolid drove  I was equipped to live that life with
relish and that life only and it was denied me  It was demolished in
order that a book or two be made out of its wreckage

She said with halfshut eyes  There is a woman at the root of all
this  And how he laughed

Did I not say you were a witch  Why most assuredly there is

He motioned with his left hand  Some hundred yards away a young man
who was carrying two logs toward New Place had paused to rest  A girl
was with him  Now laughingly she was pretending to assist the porter
in lifting his burden  It was a quaintly pretty vignette as framed by
the peach leaves because those two young people were so merry and so
candidly in love  A symbolist might have wrung pathos out of the
girls desire to aid as set against her fond inadequacy and the
attendant playwright made note of it

Well well he said  Young Quiney is a soso choice since women
must necessarily condescend to intermarrying with men  But he is far
from worthy of her  Tell me now was there ever a rarer piece of
beauty

The wench is not illfavored was the dark ladys unenthusiastic
answer  Sobut who is she

He replied  She is my daughter  Yonder you see my latter muse for
whose dear sake I spin romances  I do not mean that she takes any
lively interest in them  That is not to be expected since she cannot
read or write  Ask her about the poet we were discussing and I very
much fear Judith will bluntly inform you she cannot tell a B from a
bulls foot  But one must have a muse of some sort or another and so
I write about the world now as Judith sees it  My Judith finds this
world an eminently pleasant place  It is full of laughter and
kindlinessfor could Herod be unkind to herand it is largely
populated by ardent young fellows who are intended chiefly to be
twisted about your fingers and it is illuminated by sunlight whose
real purpose is to show how pretty your hair is  And if affairs go
badly for a while and you have done nothing very wrongwhy of
course Heaven will soon straighten matters satisfactorily  For
nothing that happens to us can possibly be anything except a benefit
because God orders all happenings and God loves us  There you have
Judiths creed and upon my word I believe there is a great deal to be
said for it

And this is you she criedyou who wrote of Troilus and Timon

I lived all that he repliedI lived it and so for a long while I
believed in the existence of wickedness
